# SmartRecruit_AI â€“ Hackathon Base Repo

This repository contains the **initial boilerplate code and folder structure** for our hackathon submission.

As per the official hackathon rules, all core logic, feature implementation, backend routes, and functional UI components will be built strictly during the 36-hour hackathon window starting from **8th July 2025, 10:00 AM IST**.

The current commit only includes:
- Boilerplate project structure (folders & files)
- UI skeletons with placeholder components
- Backend file placeholders with no logic
